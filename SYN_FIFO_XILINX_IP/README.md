# SYN_FIFO_XILINX_IP

This project implements a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) design using SystemVerilog, with testbench support for validation. The FIFO is parameterized and integrates with Xilinx IP, making it suitable for FPGA applications.

## Features
- **FIFO Design**: Implements a parameterized FIFO for handling sequential data flow.
- **Testbench**: Verifies FIFO behavior using a randomized testbench.
- **Reset Functionality**: Includes a synchronous reset mechanism.
